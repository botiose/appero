################################# DESCRIPTION #################################
This project presents a solution to the Chinese Postman Problem.

Given either directed or undirected graph with positively weighted edges a
minimum weight traversal path of all edges in the graph is returned.

#################################### USAGE ####################################

The 'solve' function can be imported with the following line:

from snowymontreal.solver import solve

An example use case is given in 'main.py' on the root folder.

################################## ALGORITHMS #################################

Three algorithms make the core of the project, these are the following:

* Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: This one is located under
                            "snowymontreal/floyd_warshall.py"

* Hierholzer Algorithm: For this one we have multiple implementations, one is
                        located under "snowymontreal/hierholzer" and the other
                        on "snowymontreal/hierholzer_it"

* Hungarian Algorithm: This one is located under "snowymontreal/hungarian.py"
