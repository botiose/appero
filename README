This project presents a solution to the Chinese Postman Problem.

Given either directed or undirected graph with positively weighted edges a
minimum weight traversal path of all edges in the graph is returned.

The 'solve' function can be imported with the following line:

from snowymontreal.solver import solve

An example use case is given in 'main.py' on the root folder.
